# MetaCognition-PoC

**Proof-of-Concept**: Minimal AI Core demonstrating meta-cognition loops without revealing core engine.

## Overview
This repository contains a Python simulation of a minimal AI demonstrating meta-cognition loops (self-awareness, consistency checking, self-feedback) with only a single awareness core active. Core engine and sensitive functionality are not exposed.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ohnicesu-droid/MetaCognition-PoC.git

cd MetaCognition-PoC

python meta_cognition_poc.py
